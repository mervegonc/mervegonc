## Projects

- (https://github.com/mervegonc/security):
- This project provides a security system that allows users to sign up for (signup) and log in (login) to a web application. It can be used to authenticate users and establish secure session management. For example, it can be used to allow users to create accounts and log in to an e-commerce website, enabling them to access the services provided by the site securely and interact safely.
- (https://github.com/octoposprime):
- "This project can be viewed as a complex system that manages a widely dispersed structure and reflects a universal perspective. Essentially, this project exemplifies a structure that shapes and maintains the general brain structure of the universe as a backend developer. The code base is an organism's cells, and these cells contribute to the functioning of the system as each component of the project. Every development we make in this project contains many connections, like an algorithm written in a universal language. Each line of code serves and completes this system like a star, and every detail discovered in the depths of this project can inspire the developer to rediscover its systemic context.‚Äù
